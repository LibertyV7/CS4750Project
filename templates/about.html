        <h1>About Our Society</h1>
        <p>
            The Washington Society, or "The Wash", was founded in 1831 with the goal of promoting the art of oratory to the UVA community. The founders of The Wash believed that the power of speech was man's greatest influence and that everyone should have the opportunity to learn fundamental oratorical skills. These beliefs have been upheld by the Society for over a century as The Wash continues to promote the development of oratory for any UVA student who wishes to learn. Filled with traditions from the past as well as the topics and humor of the modern day, The Wash is a unique society that has a place for everyone.
